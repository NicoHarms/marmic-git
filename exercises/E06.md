# E6: Branches

Create a new branch called `branching` with `git switch --create branching`

Make some changes to your files, like `README.md`. Also add one or two new files.

Add those files to the staging area.

Commit the staged files.

Take a look at `git log` and your file system.

Switch to your main branch `git switch main` and back. Observe the `git log` output and your filesystem again.
